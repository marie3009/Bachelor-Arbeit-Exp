# Bachelor-Arbeit-Exp
Here all the files of the different experiences we tried.

List of all the experiences we did to show to what extent is clickbait content given greater prominence. This list is in the order of our work: 

Content-based filtering:
- analysis
- tf-idf
- word2vec
- sentence transformer
- content based filtering

In order to try successfully our experience, you have to run the files tf-idf, word2vec and sentence transformer, because they are going to create new files that we are going to need for the next step. After that you just have to run the content based filtering file, being sure that the required files have been successfully created, and that's it! 

Collaborative filtering:
- create profils
- collab filtering random user
- collab filtering 50-50 user
- collab filtering 55-45 user

Please do not execute the "create profils" file. We already posted on GitHub the required csv files to do the collaborative filtering. Once you've saved those three csv files, you just have to choose which experience you want to try first! The collab filtering random user file uses the csv file: user_interactions_random. The collab filtering 50-50 user uses the csv file: user_interactions_50_50.csv. And the collab filtering 50-50 user uses the csv file: user_interactions_bias_55_45.csv.
