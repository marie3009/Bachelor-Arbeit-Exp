# Bachelor-Arbeit-Exp
Here all the files of the different experiences we tried.

List of all the experiences we did to show to what extent is clickbait content given greater prominence. This list is in the order of our work: 

Content-based filtering:
- analysis
- tf-idf
- word2vec
- sentence transformer
- simulation
- content based filtering

Collaborative filtering:
- create profils
- collab filtering random user
- collab filtering 50-50 user
- collab filtering 55-45 user

Please do not execute the "create profils" file. We already posted on GitHub the required csv files to do the collaborative filtering.
